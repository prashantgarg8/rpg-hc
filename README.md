# RPG-HC: The Hacker's Quest

Welcome to **RPG-HC**, a terminal-based role-playing game where you don’t slay dragons—you squash bugs, debug demons, and battle legacy code. Built for devs who love a little chaos with their caffeine.

## What Is This?

RPG-HC is a Python-powered RPG set in a developer’s universe. You pick your dev archetype (Frontend, Backend, Fullstack, or Hardware Hacker), level up by defeating software-themed enemies, and unlock skills like “Stack Overflow” and “Pizza Heal.” It’s silly, nerdy, and surprisingly addictive.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prashantgarg8/rpg-hc.git
   cd rpg-hc
   ```

2. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. Choose your dev class, fight off bugs, and level up like a true hacker.

## Classes

Each class comes with its own HP, attack range, and tools:

| Class            | HP  | Attack Range | Tools                          |
|------------------|-----|--------------|--------------------------------|
| Frontend Dev     | 95  | 7–17         | Laptop, Wi-Fi, CSS Flexbox     |
| Backend Dev      | 110 | 9–19         | Laptop, APIs, SQL              |
| Fullstack        | 100 | 8–18         | Laptop, Git, Debug Goggles     |
| Hardware Hacker  | 105 | 6–21         | Soldering Iron, Breadboard     |

## Enemies

You’ll face off against foes like:
- Segmentation Fault
- Merge Conflict
- JavaScript Bug
- Stack Overflow Demon
- Legacy Code Dragon (Boss fight!)

Each enemy scales with your level, so don’t get too comfy.

## Items & Skills

- **Coffee**: Heals 40 HP
- **Energy Drink**: Heals 80 HP but stuns you next turn
- **Debug Kit**: Buffs your attack for 3 turns

Unlock skills as you level up:
- Debug Surge
- Stack Overflow
- Pizza Heal

## Why This Exists

Honestly? Because coding is already an RPG. You grind, you level up, you fight bugs. This game just makes it literal—and fun.

## Known Quirks

- No save/load system yet (it’s a one-sitting adventure)
- AI for enemies is basic (they mostly just attack)
- Inventory system is functional but not fancy
